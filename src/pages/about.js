          <h2>Hi, I'm Adriano</h2>
          <p>I'm a final year 🇫🇷 <span className="bold">French</span> and 🇮🇹 <span className="bold">Italian</span> student at the 🎓 <span className="bold">University of Warwick</span> studying Business Management.</p>
          <p>I was born in Italy, then lived in Saudi Arabia, France, the United States, and finally the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p>I love football, tech, learning languages, and gaming. I've always had a strong interest in technology and everything related to the digital world. But I've also always been fascinated by the business world, startups, and entrepreneurship, hence my degree.</p>
          <p>Wanting to learn more about building products, I've started learning UI/UX design a year ago and programming 7 months ago. I've designed and built this website from scratch, and have participated in other design and programming projects you can explore <span className="underline"><a href="#">here</a></span>.</p>
